"""
middleware.py: Middleware class for handling faults at the driver level.

This module provides an abstract middelware class that is implemented by
each of the custom middleware classes for each component driver.

The goal of the middleware is to catch the exceptions generated by the driver
and convert them into uniquely known exceptions that can be handled by the
flight software.
